# Deploy a high-availability web app on AWS using CloudFormation
This project was the second project prior to the completion of the DevOps nano degree at Udacity. The project is comprised of deploying a web application on an EC2 instance using infrastructure as code technology(CloudFormation)

## The project was divided into two main parts:
1. Diagram: Designing an infrastructure diagram
2. Script (Template and Parameters): The second part involves making use of the infrastructure diagram to create the CloudFormation script that spins up the infrastructure and configures the apache server and deploys the web app.
